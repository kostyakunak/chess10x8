**My friend and I play chess every Sunday, and it's actually become a habit.**
At one point, I thought: what if the board weren't 8x8, but 10x8 with extra squares, while still keeping the original number of chess pieces? So many new combinations and strategies...

Give it a try!

P.S. try to tap the rook three times)))_
